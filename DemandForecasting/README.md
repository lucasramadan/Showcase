# Demand Forecasting

While in my later years at Enjoy Technology, I created the first bottoms-up forecast of customer Demand. <br>

This was a highly visible project, with stakeholders ranging from Operations to Finance and requiring buy-in from C suite. Implications of the output were broad and marked, directly affecting how the entire business was scaled across Employees, Inventory and Countries. I presented my work multiple times to various audiences, including to the CEO directly. <br>

It was created purely from our internal online traffic data and intentionally kept independent from the tops-down finance forecast. In this way, it was highly impactful in challenging assumptions and building consensus. Because it was generated within our Data platform, it could be easily connected to downstream processes, which ensured that various parts of the business were in-sync as customer patterns changed.
